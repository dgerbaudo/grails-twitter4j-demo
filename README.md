Demo App
--------
This is a very small demo-app. It has a single controller that sends a text if you hit it.

Please note, that you should have your twitter configuration outside of `Config.groovy` as having it in the
application is not safe, since you could accidentally commit it to your public repo in GitHub. 

Instead place your private configurations is:

`~/.grails/grails-twitter4j-demo-config.groovy`

There will at some point come more examples in this demo app. Hold your Tweeps.
